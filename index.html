<h1>Hello, my name is Sasha and I'm a young artist hailing from Serbia, studying in Malta! ^____^ </h1>
<h2>About myself</h2>
<p>
I have been drawing since I know of myself. I thoroughly enjoy gaming and game art, along with writing and 3d modelling!
I am aspiring to become a concept artist and illustrator in the near future, I hope you enjoy looking at my work! (o･ω･o)
